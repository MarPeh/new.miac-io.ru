<p>Regional Duma was established in December 1994. It consists of 36 representatives (members) who are elected by the population for a term of five years. The latest elections were held in December 2011. Half of members were elected in single-seat constituencies (electoral districts), the rest 18 &ndash; in the unified regional electoral district in proportion of the number of votes cast for regional lists of candidates nominated by political parties.</p>

<p>12 profile committees are formed in Duma. Committees prepare the maters for final consideration at the Duma's plenary sessions. The main form of Duma's activity is a session. Duma convenes in sessions once a month, as a rule.</p>

<p>Duma&rsquo;s role is to provide the legislative support and effective interaction between authorities of local, regional and federal levels. Duma’s members pay a very close heed to the regional development. We are working to establish the regional regulatory and legal framework. It includes the tax legislation, legislation which ensures the environmental security, the bills which stimulate the production, investments and innovations, the laws which could create conditions for attraction and training of highly qualified labor force.</p>

<p>For working out the regional laws we conduct the parliamentary hearings with participation of federal and regional authorities, municipalities, businessmen, experts and non-governmental organizations.</p>

<p>On the issues which are out of our regional competence we cooperate with profiled committees in the Federal Parliament. We are able to introduce the draft bills of federal laws using our power to introduce legislation in State Duma.</p>

<p>The tool for interaction with local authorities is Coordinative Body for municipals councils which were established in the  Regional Duma. Duma’s members have rather good interaction with voters in the constituencies, all Duma's members regularly visit their constituencies, meet people and try to solve their problems.</p>
