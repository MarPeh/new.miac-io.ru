<p>Almost three centuries ago, on the 12<sup>th</sup>Â of January 1722, Peter I issued a decree in which was stated: &quot;Today there is nothing as important for us to work on as the realisation of a vital need of the government in appointing fitting people who are chicks from the Petrov nest to the posts of general- and &uuml;ber-prosecutors.&quot;</p>

<p>Since 1996 the 12th of January has been marked as a celebration for the workers of the bodies and institutions of the Russian Federation`s Public Prosecutor`s Office.</p>

<p>The Prosecutor`s Office of Russia was established by Peter I after the victorious conclusion of the lengthy war with Sweden, when Russia was proclaimed an Empire and Peter I was confronted with the issue of the successful continuation of his reforms: the strengthening of central power and the struggles with separatists, localists and the influence of official bureaucracy. Without this step it was impossible to start the implementation of plans for Russia`s economic transformation and the formation of a powerful state.</p>

<p>On visits to Germany, England and France Peter I studied the approach to legal questions in Europe and, after thoroughly investigating and understanding them, made a decision about the creation in Russia of the necessary bodies. Drawing on France`s experience, he created an inspection body, which had previously been the auditor-general, and on-duty guard officers in the Senate, unlike the previous system of fiscality and even the Senate itself. These were not monitoring bodies; they possessed functions of administration, including of inspection, and were supplied with different tasks from those given to the Public Prosecutor`s Office.</p>

<p>Addressing a senator of the first prosecutor-general Pavel Ivanovich Yaguzhinskiy, Peter I made it understood what place in the government he intended to allocate to the Prosecutor`s Office, saying: &quot;Here is the eye through which I shall see everything. He knows my intentions and requests: that he considers what you do and displays to you that he is acting explicitly for my benefit and that of the state. Fulfil his command as if it were my own.&quot;</p>

<p>After the death of Peter I the fate of the Public Prosecutor`s Office became uncertain. Its role occasionally diminished and was even reduced to nothing. As the years passed the post of prosecutor-general was left barely noticeable and the office was practically abolished. The Public Prosecutor`s Office fell into decay in the years of the weakening Russian state, when confusion and chaos in the state mechanism and administration were observed. This is how it was in the years of Catherine I`s rule and that of the regent Anna Leopoldovna. On the other hand, when the Russian state was on the ascent and legislation was being intensely perfected and carried out to some degree by the omnipotent magnates and officials, the role of the Public Prosecutor`s Office was growing as it enjoyed its best times. An example of this was the government of Catherine II, which consulted the prosecutor-general and emphasised its absolute trust in the office. In the years of Catherine II`s reign not only was there a sharp revival of the prosecutor-general over other officials and institutions, but there also formed a hierarchical structure to the system of the Prosecutor`s Office as a fully authorised body of control. At this time the role of the bodies of the Public Prosecutor`s Office in gubernias (administrative regions) was also growing. The ratification in 1775 of the document &quot;The institutions of gubernias&quot; provided for the division of prosecutor control. For instance, it was decreed therein that &quot;Gubernia prosecutors watch and vigilantly deal everywhere with the maintenance of procedure, using the laws determined by both industry and by the conditions of the case in hand.&quot;</p>

<p>It is impossible not to note that in this period the prosecutors` posts began to be filled by representatives of noble birth. The public prosecutor of the Voronezh gubernia in this period was court councillor Alexei Fedorovich Shagarov, who later served with collegial advisors and then became chairman of the gubernia`s Chamber of the Civic Court.</p>

<p>In March 1782 he was relieved by collegial advisor Alexander Borisovich Sontsov, who held the post of gubernia prosecutor for over ten years. He was an educated, active person, admired by the residents of Voronezh. In 1793 he became vice-governor, and the next year governor, of Voronezh. The diligence and thoroughness of service in particular of A.B. Sontsov earned him the order of St Anne, 1st degree, and the full cross of St Prince Vladimir, 2nd degree.</p>

<p>In 1802 a ministerial system of managing the state was introduced by Emperor Alexander I. A Ministry of Justice was formed, and the court system became part of it. Gavriil Romanovich Derzhavin was appointed the first Justice Minister in the history of Russia, fulfilling the functions of prosecutor-general at the same time.</p>

<p>The legal reforms of Alexander I were without doubt necessary and progressive, and played a positive role in the development of the state and the democratising tendencies in Russian society: the examination of cases in the courts started to be implemented on the principles of openness, equality and contestation, and a jury was introduced. The influence of these reforms is still being felt today, as a developed concept of legal reform in the Russian Federation is actively realised.</p>

<p>In 1862 Alexander II approved the &quot;Fundamental Status of the Public Prosecutor`s Office&quot;, in which the general control of the Prosecutor`s Office was restricted.</p>

<p>The controlling functions of the Public Prosecutor`s Office were restricted to a large degree again after the legal statutes of 1864.</p>

<p>Reform was realised extremely slowly and was only completed at the start of the 20th Century. The essence of the legal reform consisted of limiting the control of the Public Prosecutor`s Office, in that its work was implemented only in the area of the courts and in support of the prosecution. As a result the system of prosecutor control changed, and the gubernia`s Prosecution Office conceded more and more ground to the prosecutors emerging in legal bodies.</p>

<p>Many well-known representatives of work and science spoke out against the reduction in the monitoring functions of the Public Prosecutor`s Office. For instance, A.F. Koni figuratively remarked that: &quot;In the hasty implementation of a desire to quickly clear space for new plantations, overgrown with weeds and half rotted with trees was a fallen oak, worthy of guarding the woods.&quot;</p>

<p>With the completion of the October Revolution the bodies of the Public Prosecutor`s Office were liquidised and didn`t come into existence again until 1922.</p>

<p>The necessity of their reconstruction as bodies of control over law and order was provoked by the fact that after the devastation of the civil war and the period of &quot;war communism&quot;, the country started to restore its national economy. This demanded strict legislative regulation of economic activity and of all aspects of our state.</p>

<p>On the 28th of May 1922, by a decree of the Russian Central Executive Committee, the Public Prosecutor`s Office of the Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic was created &quot;for the whole implementation of control over the maintenance of laws, and in the interests of the correct formulation of the fight against crime.&quot;</p>

<p>44 year-old Konstantin Nikandrovich Tyumentsev was appointed the first prosecutor of Voronezh gubernia on the 26th of June 1922.</p>

<p>Having become the gubernia`s prosecutor, he invested lots of strength and energy to the organisation of the work of the Prosecutor`s Office, to the building up of its personnel structure and to the training of specialists. Despite the fact that the volume of work was very large and the conditions difficult, the gubernia`s Prosecution Office was working at full strength by as early as August 1922.</p>

<p>With the development of the prosecution system, the accumulation of experience and the maturing authority of the prosecution bodies, and the strengthening of the new state formation &quot; the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics &quot; arose the necessity of determining the status of the union government`s prosecution bodies. In 1933 the Public Prosecutor`s Office of the USSR was created.</p>

<p>The creation of the Voronezh Prosecutor`s Office was linked to the formation in June 1934 of Voronezh Oblast (administrative region). At the same time, Pavel Sergeyevich Andreyev was appointed general prosecutor of the USSR.</p>

<p>There having begun in the 1930s a period of unfounded repression, the development of the Public Prosecutor`s Office slowed down, and although the USSR`s 1936 constitution established that the Prosecutor`s Office would implement supreme control over the maintenance of law and order, this didn`t happen - particularly in the period of work of the USSR`s prosecutor A.Y. Vyshinskiy. On the whole the prosecutors followed the line of maintaining law and order, but as a result they were themselves subjected to repression, and many of them were shot.</p>

<p>As is well known, the suppression of the majority of prosecutors then completely removed the implementation of control over law and order in the work of the State Political Directive (OGPU) and the People`s Commissariat for Internal Affairs (NKVD) on criminal matters involving so-called counter-revolutionary crimes.</p>

<p>On the 8th of June 1938, with the authorisation of the USSR prosecutor Vyshinskiy, the prosecutor of Voronezh oblast Kozma Semenovich Nikitochkin was arrested and accused of counter-revolutionary acts. He was interrogated for a year and, of course, subjected to means of physical and moral influence. But K.S. Nikitochkin held out.</p>

<p>In September 1939 the criminal charges against him were dropped for a lack of evidence, and he was released from custody. Today we admire his courage.</p>

<p>The harsh years of the Second World War hold a special place in the history of the Public Prosecutor`s Office. The oblast`s prosecutor in this period was Roman Dmitriyevich Yendovitskiy.</p>

<p>At the start of the war around 75% of the able-bodied workers of the Public Prosecutor`s Office left for the front. Those that remained shouldered a greatly increased load and a larger responsibility, seeing as Voronezh oblast saw fighting in the first days of the war.</p>

<p>In the regions of the oblast occupied by the Germans, workers of the Prosecutor`s Office joined partisan groups, and one was detained for carrying out a resistance exercise in the enemy`s rear. Not all of them survived.</p>

<p>Detectives and prosecutors may have changed over the generations, but the best traditions have been preserved: devoted service to the law, responsibility, honesty and decency.</p>

<p>This story, above all, is one of people - people with names that are linked to the events, changes, initiatives and particularities of their work.</p>

<p>It is very important for future generations to preserve the memories of those who, with justice, self-sacrificing labour, courageous deeds, flawless attitude towards their work and professional skill, have reinforced the authority of the Public Prosecutor`s Office, defended civic truth and protected the interests of state and society.</p>
